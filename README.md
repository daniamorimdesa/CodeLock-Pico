# CodeLock - Digital Safe with Raspberry Pi Pico W ðŸ”’
**_Developed as a response to a challenge during the EmbarcaTech program._**  

## About the Project
CodeLock is a secure digital safe system developed as part of the EmbarcaTech course. It utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico to implement password-based access control, featuring a 4x4 matrix keypad, OLED display, servo motor, and buzzer for feedback. The project is designed with a modular architecture for improved scalability and maintainability.

## Usage Instructions:
```
  - Default password: 1234
  - Enter a 4-digit password and press '#' to validate.
  - Press '*' to reset the input and enter the password again.
  - Press 'A' to set a new 4-digit password and confirm with '#'.
  - If the wrong password is entered 3 times, the system will lock for 10 seconds.
  - After the safe is opened, press 'C' to close it.
    
```

## What is EmbarcaTech? 
**EmbarcaTech** is a professional training program aimed at university students in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and related areas, focusing on **Embedded Systems and Internet of Things (IoT)**. The program consists of two phases:

1. **Online Training (3 months)** â€“ Covers concepts and practical development in embedded systems.
2. **Technology Residency (12 months)** â€“ Practical application of knowledge in case studies and projects in fields such as education, security, industry, and healthcare.
   
This project is part of the first phase of the program, serving as a hands-on embedded systems development experience.
